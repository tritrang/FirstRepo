# How to Run This App

1. Download PostgreSQL and set up local host. Make sure to write down any password you create during the setup process.
This is important because you will need the password to access your local host database later.
2. Make a copy of the .env example file. Then change the local host credentials accordingly to yours.
3. I would strongly recommend using DBeaver as your SQL Editor, but this is my personal choice. You can use any editor you want.
4. Now run the program with app.py. Your app is up and running now! :)
